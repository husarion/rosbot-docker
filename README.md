# rosbot-docker

Docker Image for ROS Melodic Node providing interface for STM32 firmware over ROS-serial.

`rosbot-docker` contain following ROS packages:
- [rosbot_ros](https://github.com/husarion/rosbot_ros)
- [rosbot_ekf](https://github.com/husarion/rosbot_ekf)

With *docker-compose* configuration shown in [demo](./demo) it can communicate with hardware of both Rosbot 2.0 and Rosbot 2.0 Pro.

## Flashing the firmware | switch kinematics

Firmware if flashed from inside of the container. In order to use specific kinematics flash matching firmware.

### Differential kinematics (normal wheels)

``` bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged \
husarion/rosbot:noetic \
/flash-firmware.py /root/firmware_diff.bin
```

### Mecanum kinematics

```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged \
husarion/rosbot:noetic \
/flash-firmware.py /root/firmware_mecanum.bin
```

## Building locally

``` bash
docker buildx build \
--platform linux/amd64 \
-t rosbot-docker-test \
.
```

<!-- ## Configuring Orbbec Astra

In *docker-compose.yaml* you have to change `device` passed to docker. For more information refer to `astra-docker` [README.md](https://github.com/husarion/astra-docker) -->

## Autonomous Navigation Demo

in a [/demo/autonomous_navigation_mapping](/demo/autonomous_navigation_mapping) folder your will find an example of how to use ROSbot docker image in a real autonomous navigation use case.
